//html stands for hypertext markup language
other hypertext languages are :xml ,html5
xhtml
wile naming any file ,we use the dot notation to specify the file extension (file format)
basic syntax of html is as follows:
Documenttype>>tells your ide that tis document is a html document 
this is followed by declaring the html tags themselves>>these tags enclose everything else in the webpage 
except the doctype thml 
after that we have the head tag >>this is where we link the website to all dependancies and other file extension
ie)css files ,javscript files,libraries,frameworks,meta tags
IT CONTAINS THE     title tag which contains thename of the website 
we have the body tag >>this comprises of the content of the website :semantic tags and non semantic tags 
footer tag:comprises of location ,maps,contact links 
content on the head is not displayed on the website

evry conent in html should always be inside the html tags which have an opening and a closing tag 
this tags are defined by the greater than and less than symol 
the opening tag has only the greater than and less than symbbol while the closing tag has a front slash in additin to the other sywmol
